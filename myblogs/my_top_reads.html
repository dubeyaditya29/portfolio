            <p>I was never fond of reading books but the quarantine had given me the perfect opportunity to
                start reading those books which I always wanted to or had seen amazing reviews online but never dared to touch them. Here I would like to list
                down my top 3 books which I had read last year. These are only 3 of my personal
                favourites.So lets goo and diven in!!</p>
                <br>
                <h3 style="display: block;margin-top:20px;margin-left: 30%;">-- List --</h3><br>
                <ul class="types">
                    <li>Romance : I too had a love story</li>
                    <li>Mythological : The immortals of Meluha</li>
                    <li>Finance : Rich Dad Poor Dad</li>
                    
                </ul>

                <h3 style="display: block;margin-top:20px;margin-left: 30%;">-- I too had a love story --</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I Too Had a Love Story pulls off
                an honest and poignant tale of love as Ravinder Singh sews a heart wrenching
                love story with his simple yet appealing words. By far this is my favorite
                book and it holds a very special place in my heart which I think no other book
                can ever take that</p>
                <p>The novel is written in first
                    person, where the author tries to describe the relationship between him and
                    Khushi in such a manner that I couldn’t help but experience the entire thing
                    through Ravin’s eyes. The book tells us the story of how two strangers with
                    different goals and dreams in life met on a matrimonial site and how their love
                    bloomed, until fate put it to its ultimate test</p>

                <h3 style="display: block;margin-top:20px;margin-left: 30%;">--The immortals of Meluha --</h3><br>
                <p>Imagine all the childhood stories,
                    folklores, mythological characters and fantasies, you heard as a kid, getting
                    manifested as a book? Well it would be called, “The Immortals of Meluha.” But
                    what makes Immortals of Meluha an unique one? Its depth in the character, subtle
                    message each scene carries secretly, transformation of characters, effective
                    narration and no lag, brilliantly researched and written war strategies and lastly,
                    the point of view, of protagonist</p>
                    <p>The story starts where Shiva, the head of
                        tribe called Gunas, comes to the city of Meluha, as an immigrant. Meluha is an
                        advanced city, where the people are immortals because of Somras, an elixir
                        which keeps them alive. When Shiva enters the city of Meluha, the city of
                        Meluha finds that Shiva is the saviour. Then the plot takes into different
                        turns, where protagonists goes through a matrix of quests, answering all his
                        unanswered questions. This book ends in beautiful note, and putting many
                        unanswered questions once again, which are answered in the second book, Secret
                        </p>

                        <h3 style="display: block;margin-top:20px;margin-left: 30%;">--Rich Dad Poor Dad --</h3>
                        <br>
                <p>Robert Kiyosaki emphasizes six
                    key points throughout the book. These points — which differentiate between his
                    “poor” dad (his real dad) and the “rich” dad that helped him understand
                    business and become wealthy — are: The rich don’t work for money, importance of
                    financial literacy, minding your own business, taxes and corporations, the rich
                    invent money and the need to work to learn and not to work for money. A great read though</p>
                    <p>The points which I specifically
                        liked in this book are: the way he portrays the flawed educational system of
                        our world, he proved how being an entrepreneur is less risky, our primary residence
                        is not an asset and the way he explained about asset and liability.</p>
